ColorCollapse
=============

A tool to convert all images on a page to ones that color blind people can see

In pictures, Its a tool that turnes images like this:

![](/Prototype/Prototype/sample.jpg)

Into 

![](/Prototype/Prototype/back.png)


This may seem a strange thing to do. But by doing this it makes people who have colorblindness
able to see the colors in the image a great deal better.
